<h1>Shaping Earth's Tomorrow</h1>
<h3>Solutions and ways we can help</h3>
</header>
<main>
<p>To maintain the health of our planet, there are various steps we can take to improve and restore its condition. By taking care of the earth’s health and cleanliness, we can enhance our quality of life and that of other living beings. Simple actions can gradually become a part of our lifestyle. Here are some steps we can all take to preserve our planet:
</p>
<p><h4>Little Things</h4>
    It’s important to understand that little things do matter. This means that even small actions can have a big impact on our lives, including our planet. Actions that might seem trivial, such as littering while driving or excessive use of lighting, can significantly harm the environment. For instance, littering while driving can pollute an otherwise clean environment, not only harming the surroundings but also posing a danger to other drivers, potentially causing accidents. Therefore, these small actions should not be overlooked, as they can have large-scale consequences.
    
    Small steps such as disposing of trash properly, limiting electricity use at home, and using eco-friendly packaging are ways to help maintain our planet's cleanliness. Properly disposing of waste ensures that the environment is not polluted with trash in the wrong places. Limiting electricity use reduces the consumption of power generated from the combustion of coal, natural gas, and oil. The burning of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.
    
    Today, many stores and individuals have started shifting to using eco-friendly straws and shopping bags, thereby reducing the use of non-biodegradable plastic, which is hazardous to animals. For example, discarded plastic in the ocean can harm marine animals like turtles. This demonstrates that even small actions we might consider insignificant can greatly impact the planet. Start preserving our earth by incorporating small, environmentally-conscious habits into your daily life.</p>
    <p><h4>Maintain Cleanliness Even When Traveling</h4>
        Do you maintain cleanliness even while traveling? This includes not only trips out of town or abroad but also visits to nearby places like malls or local attractions.
        
        It’s essential to remember that cleanliness should be upheld everywhere, not just in your home but in every place you visit. Avoid leaving trash behind, especially in unfamiliar places like foreign countries. Imagine being a local and seeing tourists littering in your city. Wouldn’t that frustrate you? This is how everyone feels when they witness such behavior. Unfortunately, many people disregard this issue, believing that since it’s not their country, they won’t suffer the consequences.
        
        According to a 2016 United Nations report, UNEP estimated that the international tourism sector produced about 4.8 million tons of solid waste, representing around 14% of the total municipal solid waste generated that year. Many public places such as hotels, bars, and restaurants heavily rely on single-use items, including plastic bottles and packaging. Of the waste generated, about 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastic ends up in the ocean each year, much of it from residents and tourists living within 50 km of the coast.
        
        Not only should we manage the waste we produce while traveling, but we should also control the energy we consume. Traveling should not be an excuse to neglect environmental responsibility. On the contrary, when visiting new places, you should be even more mindful of your electricity use and waste.
        
        For example, the Indonesian State Electricity Company (PLN) has implemented initiatives like a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote sustainable tourism. These programs provide clean energy solutions for national cultural heritage sites such as Borobudur and Prambanan temples. Additionally, PLN is encouraging the use of electric vehicles and devices to reduce transportation emissions in these areas.</p>

    <h4>Create Less Waste</h4>
    No matter how small, poorly managed waste can have significant long-term consequences. In our daily lives, we produce substantial amounts of waste, often unconsciously. For instance, tissues, which we frequently use for cleaning, are made from natural materials like trees. If not used sparingly, it could deplete tree resources, which impacts air quality as trees produce the oxygen we breathe.
    
    Similarly, plastic bags are commonly used for shopping or carrying items, but the materials used in plastic bags take a long time to decompose. Below are examples of everyday items made from plastic:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Plastic bags take 10 to 20 years to decompose and break down into smaller pieces known as microplastics rather than returning to nature.</li>
        <li>Plastic 
            Straws, a widely used item, take about 200 years to decompose.</li>
        <li>
            Disposable diapers require approximately 450 years to decompose. In landfills, they may take even longer due to a lack of exposure to air.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These items dominate the composition of global waste, accounting for about 12%. Fortunately, there are increasing efforts to replace these products with more eco-friendly alternatives. Besides plastic waste, food and organic waste make up about 44% of the total global waste (the highest proportion). Organic waste, such as leftover food or food scraps, when not managed properly, produces methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some ways to manage organic waste better:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Avoid wrapping or storing organic waste in plastic and dispose of it separately.
            </li>
            <li>Clean recyclable items before throwing them away to prevent contamination during recycling processes.</li>
            <li>Store organic waste in closed compartments to avoid unpleasant odors.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>According to the FAO, about one-third of the food produced for human consumption globally (around 1.3 billion tons) is wasted every year. In Indonesia alone, nearly 13 million tons of food are wasted annually.</p>
    <p><h4>Let Go of Waste</h4>
        Reducing waste is a crucial step toward environmental preservation. It requires abandoning wasteful habits and adopting greater accountability for the waste we produce.

        Steps include reducing single-use products, recycling usable items, and practicing mindful consumption. Plastic waste doesn’t just pile up in landfills but also pollutes ecosystems, water, soil, and air.
        
        Letting go of waste involves smart shopping—choosing eco-friendly products, avoiding overconsumption, and purchasing only what is needed. Donating unused items or repurposing them into something valuable also helps reduce waste.
        
        Producers also bear responsibility. Many companies now use recycled materials in their packaging. For instance, Adidas has produced approximately 11 million pairs of shoes from recycled materials. This shows that a good company isn’t just one that releases fancy, expensive products but one that uses sustainable and recycled materials.
        
        No matter how prominent the brand, companies must also prioritize the planet’s health for the long term.</p>
