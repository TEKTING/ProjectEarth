                Earth, a planet we call home to approximately 8 billion lives. From the beginning, Earth was meant to be a place for humans and other living beings to thrive. 
                Over 4.5 billion years have passed since Earth first formed, and countless changes have occurred on our planet—ranging from weather and environment to lifestyles and much more.

In the past, the global average temperature was lower than it is today. In fact, the global average temperature continues to rise year by year, a phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. 
Many factors influence this warming, such as human activities, volcanic activity, and solar radiation. Over the past half-century, Earth's surface temperature has risen faster than at any point in the last 2,000 years. 
Research shows that the difference between the global average surface temperature during the period 2011–2020 and the pre-industrial era (1850–1900) is 1.09°C. 
During this time, well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed to warming by approximately 1°C to 2°C.
On the other hand, human activities also produce aerosols (liquid or solid particles dispersed in the air without dissolving), such as sulfate dust emitted by volcanoes, which have contributed to cooling,
though their impact is relatively small compared to GHGs.
Cooling caused by aerosols is estimated to range between 0.0°C and 0.8°C. 
Natural factors can bring either cooling or warming effects, but their influence is minor compared to GHGs, varying only between -0.1°C and +0.1°C.
Global warming has also had a significant impact on the polar ice caps in the Arctic and Antarctic. The ice at the poles is now melting, increasing Earth's water volume. 
This not only harms humans but also the animals that depend on the ice, such as penguins, seals, whales, and polar bears, which rely on the ice for hunting, shelter, and reproduction.
If the ice melts, these animals will struggle to survive. The melting polar ice also threatens coastal cities and small islands, as rising sea levels may lead to coastal flooding or submersion. 
Additionally, melting ice contributes significantly to a sharp rise in Earth's temperature, causing global weather patterns to become chaotic.
Beyond the rise in global average temperatures, another major issue is the declining air quality in certain countries each year. 
For example, in places like California, South America, Serbia, and Australia, severe pollution levels have been driven by wildfires and dust storms exacerbated by climate warming in 2020 and 2016. 
Such cases not only impact environmental health but also lead to a decline in the health of living beings.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, research showed that 84% of all monitored countries experienced an improvement in air quality, primarily due to global lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. 
This indirectly highlights that human activity has the greatest influence on air quality. When the world went into lockdown during the pandemic, 
outdoor human activities were significantly reduced, leading to fewer vehicles on the road and a temporary halt in pollution from human activities.
